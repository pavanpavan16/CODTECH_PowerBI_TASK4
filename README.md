## 📄 Description
This project demonstrates the use of Python scripting within Power BI to perform advanced data analysis and custom visualizations. The dataset used is the popular "Superstore" sample data, which includes details about orders, customers, sales, and regional performance.

Python is integrated directly in Power BI to:
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
- Create advanced visualizations such as pairplots and heatmaps
- Detect sales outliers and sales trends
- Summarize category-wise performance

## 📈 Summary
The report highlights how Python can extend Power BI’s native capabilities to include advanced statistical analysis and custom visuals. This is especially useful for data scientists and analysts who want to apply machine learning or deeper analysis within a BI environment.
