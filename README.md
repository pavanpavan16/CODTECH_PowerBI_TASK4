## üìÑ Description
This project demonstrates the use of Python scripting within Power BI to perform advanced data analysis and custom visualizations. The dataset used is the popular "Superstore" sample data, which includes details about orders, customers, sales, and regional performance.

Python is integrated directly in Power BI to:
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
- Create advanced visualizations such as pairplots and heatmaps
- Detect sales outliers and sales trends
- Summarize category-wise performance

## üìà Summary
An analytical dashboard exploring sales, profits, and orders across categories, sub-categories, and regions.
**Why Used: To dive into sales performance and identify profitable areas and categories.**

**Visuals Used: Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Line Chart.**

**Key Insights: Regional performance, category-wise profit margins, and sales order trends.**
